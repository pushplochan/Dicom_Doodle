# DicomDoodle
An Open-Source Tool for AI-Assisted and Manual Annotation of 3D MRI DICOM with Full DICOM-SEG Interoperability 

**DicomDoodle** is a Python-based, user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) tool designed to streamline the annotation, segmentation, and visualization of DICOM medical images, with a particular focus on MRI data. Developed to assist researchers, radiologists, and medical professionals, **DicomDoodle** integrates state-of-the-art deep learning models—such as **YOLO** (You Only Look Once) for object detection and **SAM** (Segment Anything Model) for precise segmentation—to automate and enhance the process of identifying and annotating regions of interest, such as tumors, in MRI images.

## Key Features
- **Automated and Manual Segmentation**: Includes tools for both automated and manual segmentation, providing flexibility to users in different scenarios.
- **2D and 3D Visualization**: Advanced visualization capabilities allow users to view DICOM images and their annotations in both 2D and 3D views.
- **Deep Learning Integration**: Powered by deep learning models like YOLO and SAM, improving segmentation accuracy and object detection.
- **DICOM Compatibility**: Saves annotations as standard DICOM segmentation files (`_seg.dcm`), ensuring compatibility with other medical imaging software.
- **MRI Focus**: Optimized for MRI image analysis, making it particularly suitable for identifying tumors and other abnormalities.
